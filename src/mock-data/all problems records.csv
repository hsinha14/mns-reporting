PBI000000025738,Critical,1-Extensive/Widespread,Closed,Applying discount multiple times using single unique promo code,"Issue: We found that there was a post on social media that a single use promo code “AE6-WFB3” was getting applied multiple times which is giving £30 off on wines. When applying the code it showed error message on the basket page however the discount was still getting applied. The promotion was deactivated around 17:00 BST after which mitigated the issue. Command centre replicated the issue with another wine promotion with following steps: •	Added applicable item into basket and applied promo code “WINE-H4XC” and went till checkout. •	Another user applied the same code simultaneously and went till checkout and could see the discount being applied. 	 RCA: On analysis we found that this issue is occurring for single use promo code in following scenario: •	User “U1” applied code “A” in basket however does not place the order (the promo code is not yet redeemed). The system marks the promo code to be “applied on order” but not yet redeemed. •	Simultaneously, multiple users can apply the same code “A” and the discount will be applied to the users. •	Users can place orders with promo code “A” until the first user has completed the order i.e. Redeemed the promo code, after which the promo code cannot be used.  We have found that this is a known IBM issue and has been there in the system since day1. This issue has been fixed in FEP8 and thus will be fixed once we upgrade to FEP8 (due to be live on 13th Sep). If we have to fix this issue before FEP8 go live, we would need a custom fix which would require a WCS patch build and a DBCR change. The dev efforts for the fix has been identified as 2days for fix and testing.",AKASH GUPTA,8/31/2016 12:00:00 AM,,8/28/2016 11:51:58 PM,sumit.gupta@mnscorp.net,,,,9/15/2016 8:24:54 PM,9/15/2016 8:24:54 PM

Specifically, the reporting of PLP (Product List Page) page names is broken and it now only records the name ‘uk:web:browse:plp’ for all PLPs instead of the specific page names such as ‘uk:web:browse:plp:women>dresses’ (e.g. for the page at http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/women/dresses).   Also, the reporting of DLP (Display Landing Pages) page names is completely broken and does not record a page name at all (e.g. for the page at http://www.marksandspencer.com/c/women).   The Command Centre has been alerted to this problem, but we’d like this raised as an incident so that we can track progress.  Initially the Browse team (headed by Peter Rostron) have been asked to fix the problem, as the tracking of these pages falls under their area of the website code.  Let me know if you need more info.

PBI000000018095,High,2-Significant/Large,Closed,Duplicate Sparks registration email,"Date: 16/10/2015 Ref: 7695214 Incident Start Time: 16/10 15:38 Service Restored Time: 16/10 19:20 Incident Close Time: 30/10 17:00  Total Incident Time: 3 hours 42 minutes Incident Owner: Elaine Hawthorn   Issue When customers register their Sparks card an email is sent to the customer. It would appear in some instances customers are receiving 2 emails. The first with their name and the second with a different unrelated name.    Impact Analysis has shown 957 Customers (~3%) have received a duplicate email out of 35,000 registrations which have taken place today. However, there have only been 3 shouts today (and 1 yesterday) regarding this issue. Customers are concerned and questioning data security leading to potential brand damage.     Recovery Actions Support bridge has been opened. Security team fully engaged.  Analysing the scale of the issue.  Due to the Sparks registration being taken offline it is difficult to re-create the issue.  Analysis is on going along the system journey to understand where the duplication is happening.    16/10 19:20 A workaround has been enabled that will result in the omission of all customer name’s from the registration email template that is sent out customers when they first register– This will mitigate impact as customers will receive a more general email that will not specifically address them by name. The workaround since being enabled has been tested by creating a test registration account and it has been confirmed by the registration email received that it is working as expected. Additional logging has been enabled within the Loyalty layer from which the messages are sent – The logging will assist the support teams in diagnosing the root cause of the issue. The logs that will be received over the weekend will be reviewed and the investigation in to root cause will remain ongoing.  19/10 12:00 Additional email data has been received from exact Target and is currently being analysed in an effort to understand how many instances of duplicate emails were received by customers over the weekend – In parallel the Loyalty logs that were enabled on Friday have also been extracted and support teams are reviewing these logs as part of their investigation.  19/10 16:15 Through analysis of the Loyalty log files support have determined that duplicate messages are being sent to Loyalty from the WCS Platform Layer. The platform support team are currently trying to reproduce the issue on the SIT3 Staging Environment - Additional logging has also been enabled on SIT3 to further assist the Platform teams investigation.  20/10 11:00 Platform support were unable to successfully replicate the issue on the staging environment however they were able to identify a possible code fix which may resolve the issue. The fix is currently being tested and validated by the development team.  20/10 16:20 The development teams are still working on the fix and are validating on the staging environment – The timing arrangement for the deployment to the live environment is still to be confirmed.  20/10 18:30 The fix has been validated and is ready for deployment – Deployment to the live environment has been delayed until the Friends and Family promotional event has completed next Monday.  22/10 16:20 The contact centre have received reports from 18 customers advising that duplicate emails were sent to them following registration of their Sparks account today – The first email stated the correct name and the second email stated an incorrect name.  Upon investigation it was found that the workaround fix that was applied on Friday was unintentionally reverted when the entire template was amended in readiness for the Sparks Friends and Family event - This has since been corrected as of 15:41 and the names are no longer included on any Sparks registration confirmation email.  27/10 11:30 The fix is tested and ready for deployment however has been placed on hold until 2nd November due to ongoing change activities for Release 20.  30/10 16:15 The workaround remains in place. Although duplicate registration emails are still being received, the emails are not personally addressing the customers and therefore the impact of the original issue is mitigated. The issue will be fully resolved once the proposed fix has been deployed to the live environment which is planned for implementation in Release 21.

On investigation we found that the issue is coming because WCS is sending small case post code in NDD, reserve or ATP requests. At Sterling end, the post codes are present only in upper case and as a result the requests fails because Sterling consider it as invalid post code. The reason for lower post code getting saved at WCS end was because of sparks registration journey where conversion logic for upper case was not present. This was fixed by loyalty team later.   But the issue is that this scenario can again happen in future where through some api, post codes gets saved in lower post code in WCS database. So there should be a fix in place at WCS end to convert the post code into upper case before constructing NDD, ATP, Reserve, transfer order and sync transfer requests.   To fix the issue in WCS JIRA : SHOPBC-5902 is logged.  Currently its in backlog.",11/27/2015 3:23:00 PM,11/27/2015 3:23:00 PM

The business have confirmed there are no significant product launches or takedowns which are due to happen today. Customers will not be see the latest products   Recovery Actions The support teams are engaged on a bridge and have identified an issue with a temporary file causing the overnight product feed for TSOPs to fail The support teams are replaying the TSOPs product feed file by removing the temporary file and are working on understanding the permissions issue which is causing the failure to prevent a re-occurrence tomorrow It has been agreed with the business to not restart the TSOPs to force them to consume the file as there are no significant product updates to be applied today and this would have a bigger impact on the customer The support teams have successfully replayed the file through to the TSOPs environment but as previously stated the TSOPs will not be updated until tomorrow morning – the teams are now focused on root cause analysis and making sure the same issue does not re-occur tomorrow Manual workaround to remain in place until we have a permanent resolution Root cause investigations today have led us to believe the issue is due to the naming convention of the file, investigation will continue over the weekend to confirm this analysis. The workaround was successful through weekend – support team continued to move the previous days file out of the way manually and checked that the new daily file being sent across around midnight was successfully processed.

PBI000000012483,High,2-Significant/Large,Closed,Delay in orders flowing from WCS to Sterling,Background and Service restoration details -  Support team are investigating the situation to understand why the reindexing is taking longer to complete It has been noticed that number of orders being placed on the website currently is higher than normal Initial investigation reveals some database reindexing job is running could potentially cause the delay in order processing in WCS The stuck order count has been catching up and the count has been reduced to 450 orders as at 1:40pm  The database re-indexing job completed at 14:32 and the order backlogs in WCS have drastically dropped to be well within normal limits.  Some changes are being considered and planned to alleviate this kind of problem going forward and one of this change is being planned tonight There are no delays in order flowing from WCS to Sterling anymore Next steps aligned to support teams as part of problem log process   Root cause This issue was caused due to prolonged running of reindexing job on Wednesday   Remedial steps 1. Change the reindexing scheduler to spread out the jobs across the week 2.

As shown in the below graph , the spike is not on CPU utilization of the database server , but on the concurrency and other. The spike on concurrency is explainable as the below query ran into a lock wait  condition which caused the spike in concurrency. Once the query was killed, the spike on concurrency vanished.  2.	This query ( housekeeping of multiple pending orders) in now running daily at 2 AM. Since then we have not seen any spike in concurrency as at 2AM order volume is very less. Also, this query is taking just 15 mins to complete. So, no issues seen afterwards.  3.	Thirdly, nightly job cycle or stage propagation job has no bearing on the spike observed on 6th Nov. The nightly jobs starts at 10:30 but all the jobs runs on authoring database. Only stage propagation job interacts with the live database. On 6th Nov , stage propagation started on 11:05 PM.

PBI000000017357,Medium,3-Moderate/Limited,Closed,This PBI was raised on the back of SEV2 incident INC7478614 for tracking RCA.,"Stores Incorrectly Defaulting to Edgware Road Store on M&S.com+ –  Ongoing Date: 23/09/2015 Ref: 7478614 Incident Start Time: 18/09 13:30 (Escalated Sev 2) Service Restored Time: TBC Incident Close Time: TBC Total Incident Time: TBC Background:  When logging in to M&S.com+ multiple stores are incorrectly being defaulted to Edgware road store rather than their own store. Impact:   Sales from multiple stores are being incorrectly attributed to Edgware Road store. It has been identified that 155 stores have had approximately 3,000 orders incorrectly attributed to Edgware Road store which translates to £123k in incorrect sales being reported. No actual customer impact as orders are still being placed on M&S.com+ - This is purely a reporting related issue. Although we have received a few reports of the incident occurring on the M&S.com+ on iPads however it seems the issue is more prevalent on desktop users accessing M&S.com+. The incorrect store name will be displayed on M&S.com+ and orders for Edgware Road store will be displayed on the collection screen instead of orders for the actual store. Recovery Actions:     A reconciliation report has been provided to the Platform team with a listing of the ID’s that the store uses to login to M&S.com+ along with the list of order numbers that have been erroneously attributed to Edgware Road. The teams are analysing log files using the data provided from the report to understand why the stores are being incorrectly defaulted to Edgware Road. To mitigate the impact a front end message has been added to M&S.com+ advising store users to check they are logged in as the correct store and to log a call with the IT Service Desk if they require any assistance.  In parallel the SIT Team at Stockley Park are investigating whether there are any issues on the MyStoresWorkspace (The store’s Internal Portal) link used by the Store Advisors to access M&S.com+.

Change CRX tar optimization timing to 3:00AM or 2:30AM (2). Fixing inconsistent repository issue - Hi All, I have checked that CRX optimizes the tar files daily at 2:00 AM (this is default CQ implementation ) in the night and last night the backup process and tar optimization coincided and both were running in parallel. I searched for the timings of these processes in the logs for last few days and found that the backup was finishing at 1:58 AM and Tar optimization was starting at 2 AM. (PS logs below). I think this issue may reoccur again tonight if we do not change the timings of the backup as there is high probability that both processes can run in parallel. Though I have raised a ticket with Adobe but we should change the backup timings on Production to prevent this happening again tonight.
